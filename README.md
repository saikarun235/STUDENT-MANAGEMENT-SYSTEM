# STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

A systematic educational institution requires the maintenance and organization
of student database. To further understand this, each institution has various
departments which are further classified into different sections. Student database
has to be maintained on the basis of a student's section as well as their department.
This information could be general details like sudent name, address, performance,
attendance, achievements and so on. Student database is a single module which has
to be maintained alongside several other modules, therefore requiring to be automated
and centralized as information from one module will be required by other modules.
Therefore, all the modules are interdependent.
For example, to view the marks of a student in their profile, will require the
assistance of the Examination branch module. Therefore, the project aims at efficiency
and accuracy. The administrators of the system will be able to record and retrieve
student information, manage their attendance with ease. The project therefore is
also useful for saving time by reducing the paper and manual work such as maintaining
the documents.
